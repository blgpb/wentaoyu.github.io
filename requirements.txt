Academic Personal Website Requirements
=====================================

1. Objectives & Audience
   - Showcase the portfolio of a Computer Science PhD student (research areas, publications, collaborations) to peers, faculty, and potential industry partners.
   - Maintain a professional, accessible, English-only presence that can be kept up to date via a lightweight admin/editor workflow.

2. Information Architecture
   - Primary navigation items: Home, Research Areas, Publications, Biography, Contact, plus an optional Updates section for news/talks/awards.
   - Global footer with copyright notice, last-updated timestamp, and quick links to CV, Google Scholar, GitHub, LinkedIn, and ORCID.

3. Page-Level Requirements
   a. Home
      - Hero section with name, title, affiliation, and a concise research mission statement.
      - Highlight cards for the latest publication, current project, or upcoming talk.
      - Quick links to Research Areas and Publications.
   b. Research Areas
      - One card per topic (e.g., Federated Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Trustworthy AI) containing a short description, keywords, and representative figures/diagrams.
      - Each card links to related publications and project pages.
   c. Publications
      - Tabular or card list with title, venue, year, co-authors, abstract/summary, and badges for awards or best paper.
      - Links to PDF/ArXiv, project page, slides, and source code when available.
      - Filters by year/topic and a keyword search box.
   d. Biography
      - Detailed narrative covering education, research experience, collaborations, teaching/service, honors, and downloadable CV.
      - Timeline layout or sectioned cards to keep the page scannable.
   e. Contact
      - Email (with anti-scraping obfuscation), institutional address, office hours if applicable, external profiles (Scholar, GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter/X).
      - Secure contact form (name/email/message) with basic spam protection (honeypot or reCAPTCHA).
   f. Updates (optional)
      - Chronological list of recent news, talks, grants, media mentions, or blog-style reflections.

4. Visual & UX Guidelines
   - Clean, research-centric look with a professional color palette and typography that works well for long-form reading.
   - Responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile) with performance budget <2 MB initial load; include dark/light theme toggle.
   - Accessibility: semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy, alt text for images, focus-visible styles, and keyboard navigation.

5. Content Management / Backend Editing
   - Provide an authenticated admin surface (e.g., Netlify CMS, TinaCMS, or a minimal custom dashboard) to edit publications, research areas, and news without touching code.
   - Content stored in Markdown/JSON/YAML files within the repository so edits remain version-controlled.
   - Include documentation for adding/removing entries, updating assets, and publishing changes.

6. Technical Stack & Hosting
   - Build with a static-first framework (Next.js, Astro, or Hugo) to simplify deployment and keep costs at zero.
   - Configure GitHub Pages (preferred) or Vercel for free hosting; include CI workflow (GitHub Actions) to lint, build, and deploy on push to main.
   - Add SEO metadata (title/description/open-graph), sitemap.xml, RSS feed for Updates, and optional analytics (Plausible/GA) via environment flag.

7. Extensibility & Future Work
   - Hooks for integrating Google Scholar API or Semantic Scholar for automatic publication updates.
   - Support embedding interactive visualizations (e.g., research demos) and video talks.
   - Optional newsletter or RSS subscription component.

8. Deliverables
   - Wireframes for each page, style guide (colors, typography, components), finalized static site implementation, admin configuration, deployment scripts, and a maintenance handbook.

9. Timeline & Review
   - Phase 1: IA + wireframes
   - Phase 2: Visual design + component library
   - Phase 3: Implementation + CMS wiring + accessibility pass
   - Phase 4: Deployment to GitHub Pages and handoff walkthrough
