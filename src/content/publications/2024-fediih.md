summary: "A novel Graph Federated Learning method by integrally modeling the Inter-Intra Heterogeneity."
abstract: "We propose a novel method FedIIH, which naturally integrates the inter- and intra- heterogeneity in Graph Federated Learning (GFL). On one hand, our method characterizes the interheterogeneity from a multi-level global perspective, and thus it can properly compute the inter-subgraph similarities based on the whole distribution. On the other hand, it disentangles the subgraph into several latent factors, so that we can further consider the critical intra-heterogeneity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in GFL that combines both inter- and intra- heterogeneity into a unified framework."
